### (Work in Progress - Deployment soon)

#### The Why?
As a retail investor we are often pitched the watered down, high fee financial products such as insurance, robo advisors and middlemen fund managers who charge a fee to buy funds that are already publicly availble for retail investors (These funds also charge a separate fee on their own...double/triple fee sigh). ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’²

On the other side we have erratic retail traders who treat investing like a day at casino with a "IMFEELINGLUCKY" motto and end up burning up fast. **Our returns must justify the risk we took**. If we can achieve the same performance with lesser risk why should we take the riskier option?? ðŸ“‰ðŸ“‰ðŸ“‰

With some knowledge about some traditional financial math, the regular retail investor would be able to build resiliant and risk balanced portfolios on their own without incurring deadly fees. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

#### The Goal
The goal of this project is to increase awareness about how financial products are built using traditional finanicial theories (CAPM, Efficient Markets etc) with the help of technology and a user friendly interface to learn from. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
