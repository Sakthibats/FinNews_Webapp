# FinNews_Webapp 

#### The What
FinNews Webapp is designed as a portfolio health monitoring tool. It features Modern Portfolio Theory charts and includes a one-click portfolio rebalancing tool to automatically adjust portfolio proportions.

#### The Why
Retail investors are often stuck with overpriced, high-fee products like insurance plans, robo-advisors, and fund managers who charge extra to buy publicly available funds (with hidden fees inside).

On the flip side, many traders treat investing like gambling, chasing quick wins with a “feeling lucky” mindset, only to burn out. Returns must justify the risks taken. **If the same returns can be achieved with less risk, why take the riskier route?**

With the right financial knowledge, retail investors can build resilient, risk-balanced portfolios themselves—without paying excessive fees or making costly mistakes.

And that’s why we built FinNews Webapp—to empower you to invest smarter, reduce risk, and maximize returns.
